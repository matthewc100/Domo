--- STEP 5. We have 2 datasets; the first one is the full set of SFDC users - past and present - and the second is the list of klue users.  
--- We'll join the two tables based on the SFDC id, which is unique, and keep all the SFDC users.  So some klue fields will be blank.  
--- We'll fill those in later.  Later we can add in the session data, using the Klue id, which is also unique.  

SELECT sfdc.*, klue.id AS klue_id, klue.sfdc_id, klue."Has Klue Acct"
FROM prod_dpad_sfdc_users sfdc

INNER JOIN sfdc_users_with_klue_accounts klue ON (klue.sfdc_id = sfdc.id)
